Our prime time motto, 'Taking Technology to Society'​, one that was bestowed upon us by The 11th President of India Late Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam, has been the founding stone on which the slabs of scientific acumen, the walls of healthy competition and the finishing paint of technological excellence have rendered the extravagant structure of an enhancing student body. A groundbreaking line up of outstanding speakers, both international and domestic, every year at the VJTI Guest Lecture Series, is the cherry on top of the cake of insight. Equally stringent have been Technovanza's efforts to spark unrestrained, yet healthy competition between participants over the expanse of 20+ events. Technovanza intends to bring it's theme into rightful application, which is precisely why the community has been a premiere homeground for social initiatives like Mission Mumbai and Pratigya, to enhance the quality of human resource dwelling in the world of today.",
